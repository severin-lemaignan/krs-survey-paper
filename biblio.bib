	that are sufficient for an entailment to hold, and are commonly used
	to debug OWL ontologies. In JustBench , justifications form the key

	for correctness and reasoner performance instead of entire ontologies
	or random subsets. Justifications are generally small and relatively
	easy to analyse, which makes them very suitable for transparent analytic
	micro-benchmarks. Furthermore, the JustBench approach also allows
	us to isolate reasoner errors and inconsistent behaviour. We present
	the results of initial experiments using JustBench with FaCT++, HermiT,
	and Pellet. Finally, we show how JustBench can be used by reasoner
	developers and ontology engineers seeking to understand and improve
	the performance characteristics of reasoners and ontologies.},

  journal = {Cognition},

  abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict
	a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the
	social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations
	of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'.
	We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'.
	If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others
	and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using
	Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those
	with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic
	children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was
	higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs
	to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated
	is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.}

	data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can
	be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information
	to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that
	includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we
	present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework
	that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in
	an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system.
	
	Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home
	environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available
	to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration

	* Roughly the same kind of ambition and architecture.
	
	* Way better than us on the perception side. 
	
	* They try the "2nd order logic" approach. I'd be curious to know
	what kind of reasoning capability they actually have.
	
	* Their tests are conducted in a static environment. They don't take
	other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective taking
	or rich disambiguation).
	
	* No task planning at all (or at least, not discussed in this paper)
	
	
	More in details:
	
	- object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features
	
	- formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes
	to predicates
	
	- Cyc predicates
	
	- ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be
	useful for us.
	
	- idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute
	
	- location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map
	(but not much on this semantic map)
	
	- two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved
	objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore
	
	- uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL
	language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates,
	functions, etc)
	
	Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy
	to store the knowledge of each agent
	
	- disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst
	all concepts known by Cyc

	robot able to collaborate with a human and display some understanding

	that encourages parallel and incremental information processing,
	and a method for binding information from distinct representations
	that when faced with rapid change in the world can maintain a coherent,
	though distributed, view of it. Provisional results are demonstrated
	in a robot combining vision, manipulation, language, planning and

	of a great number of separate deliberative and reactive functionalities.
	This integration must be built on top of a solid foundation of data,
	information and knowledge having numerous origins, including quantitative
	sensors and qualitative knowledge databases. Processing is generally
	required on many levels of abstraction and includes refinement and
	fusion of noisy sensor data and symbolic reasoning. We propose the
	use of knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach for
	organizing such processing. Desirable properties of such middleware
	are presented and motivated. We then argue that a declarative stream-based
	system is appropriate to provide the desired functionality. Different
	types of knowledge processes and components of the middleware are
	described and motivated in the context of a UAV traffic monitoring
	application. Finally DyKnow, a concrete example of stream-based knowledge
	processing middleware, is briefly described.},

	A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in
	a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to
	the table.
	
	The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she
	will return?
	
	
	The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children)
	doesn't answer "on the table"
	
	The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an
	explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So
	it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up!
	
	
	- The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism
	model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are
	made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names
	3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of
	the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content
	of the attitude.
	
	The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a
	phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be
	interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4)
	to be a telephone.
	
	
	I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would
	be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana"
	scene.
	
	
	In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must
	be able to attribute a false belief to the agent.
	
	Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that
	allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief
	that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent.
	
	
	The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could
	be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

	a multi-layered cognitive architecture for embodied agents operating

	conscious reasoning, planning, and act selection is performed. The
	lowest layer of the GLAIR Architecture, the Sensori-Actuator Layer
	(SAL), contains the controllers of the sensors and effectors of the
	hardware or software robot. Between the KL and the SAL is the Perceptuo-Motor
	Layer (PML), which grounds the KL symbols in perceptual structures
	and subconscious actions, contains various registers for providing
	the agent's sense of situatedness in the environment, and handles
	translation and communication between the KL and the SAL. The motivation
	for the development of GLAIR has been "Computational Philosophy",
	the computational understanding and implementation of human-level
	intelligent behavior without necessarily being bound by the actual
	implementation of the human mind. Nevertheless, the approach has
	been inspired by human psychology and biology.},

  institution = {Research Note No. COSY-PR-0705},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The idea of an axiom system having some models is explained more fully
	than in previous presentations, showing how the structure of a theory
	can give some semantic content to undefined symbols in that theory,
	making it unnecessary for all meanings to be derived bottom up from
	(grounded in) sensory experience, or sensory-motor contingencies.
	Although symbols need not be grounded, since they are mostly defined
	by the theory in which they are used, the theory does need to be
	"tethered", if is capable of being used for predicting and explaining
	things that happen, or making plans for acting in the real world.
	These ideas were quite well developed by 20th Century philosophers
	of science, and I now both attempt to generalise those ideas to be
	applicable to theories expressed using non-logical representations
	(e.g. maps, diagrams, working models, etc.) and begin to show how
	they can be used in explaining how a baby or a robot, can develop
	new concepts that have some semantic content but are not definable
	in terms of previously understood concepts. There is still much work
	to be done, but what needs to be done to explain how intelligent
	robots might work, and how humans and other intelligent animals learn
	about the environment, is very different from most of what is going
	on in robotics and in child and animal psychology.
	
	
	The addition of new explanatory hypotheses is abduction. Normally
	abduction uses pre-existing symbols. The simultaneous introduction
	of new symbols and new axioms (ontology-extending abduction) generates
	a very difficult problem of controlling search.},
