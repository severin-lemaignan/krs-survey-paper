\section{Introduction}
\label{sect|intro}

\subsection{Definition of inclusion criteria}

We have setup the following criteria to select the knowledge representation
systems to include in this survey.

Those systems must:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Run on \emph{service robot} (robots that interact with objects in a
	semantic-rich environment),

	\item  Ground their knowledge in the physical world (physically embedded),
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Able to \emph{resolve entities}
		\item  Able to automatically create new object instances
	\end{itemize}

	\item  Be able to merge different knowledge modalities,
	\item  Be endowed with on-line, dynamic reasoning (not just a static
	dictionary)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

system}

\subsection{PEIS Ecology}
\label{sect|peis-ecology}

Reference paper:~\cite{Daoutis2009}

{\sc PEIS Ecology}~\cite{Saffiotti2005} is a software \emph{ecosystem} that aim to binds autonomous
robotics with ambient intelligence (network of sensors). \emph{PEIS} stands for
\emph{Physically Embedded Intelligent System}: every robots or intelligent
device in the environment is abstracted as a PEIS.

Each PEIS component is running a \emph{PEIS Kernel} instance. Communication
between instance relies on a custom P2P communication protocol.

More in details:
- object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features
- formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates
- Cyc predicates
- ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be useful for us.
- idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute
- location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map)
- two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore
- uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions, etc)
Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy to store the knowledge of each agent
- disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known by Cyc
- template based natural language
- experiment conducted in a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot

\subsubsection{Intrinsic features}
\label{sect|peis-intrinsic-features}

\paragraph{Expressiveness} The PEIS Knowledge representation system relies on
the {\sc ReseachCyc} and {\sc CycL} language to represent knowledge. The {\sc CycL} language
allows to represent first order logic sentences and has extensions for modal logics and higher order logics.

\fxfatal{Is modal logics and higher order logics actually used in PEIS?} 

As a system relying on {\sc CycL}, contexts can be expressed as
\emph{microtheories}: the truth or falsity of a set of statement depends of the
\emph{microtheory} in which these statements are evaluated.

\fxfatal{OWA/CWA?}

\subsection{Anchoring strategies}
\label{sect|peis-anchoring}

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{peis-architecture.pdf}
	\caption{The PEIS knowledge representation system, taken from~\cite{Daoutis2009}}
	\label{fig|peis-archi}
\end{figure}

The PEIS KR\&R system is deeply integrated to the general PEIS Ecology
\emph{smart} environment. Figure~\ref{fig|peis-archi} gives an overview of the
interactions between PEIS knowledge processing layers.

\paragraph{Knowledge Acquisition} The primary source for knowledge acquisition
is perception.  The PEIS ecosystem provides a SIFT-based object recognizer used
in conjunction with ceiling cameras for object localization.  Other perceptual
modalities are available (like human tracking, ambient environment monitoring).

A template-based natural language parsing system may also be used to add new
assertions to the system.

\paragraph{Anchoring} Daoutis et al. formalize the issue of anchoring as
finding a \emph{predicate grounding relation} $g \subseteq \mathcal{P} \times
\Phi \times D(\Phi)$, where $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of predicate symbols, $\Phi$
a set of percept's attributes, and $D(\Phi)$ the domain of these attributes.

In the current implementation, object category (returned by the SIFT
classifier), color, location, spatial relations (both topological -- \emph{at},
\emph{near} -- and relative to the robot -- \emph{left}, \emph{behind}, etc.)
and visibility are the five classes of extracted attributes.

\subsubsection{Integration in the robot architecture}
\label{sect|peis-integration}

The PEIS framework offers through the \emph{PEIS middleware} a practical way to
insert a new component into the shared \emph{tuple space}.  Thus, the KR\&R
module can be seemlessly integrated into the PEIS ecosystem.
